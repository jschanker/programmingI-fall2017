<h3>Spreadsheet Application Assignment 1. A Matter of Time&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hours, Minutes, Seconds) Part I</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Background (How Dates are represented in Excel and in JavaScript)</strong>: Dates and times are often represented internally as numbers. You can see this if you enter a number in Excel&nbsp;and then change its&nbsp;display to a Date/Time format. &nbsp;<span>In Excel, Dates are represented as the number of </span><em>days</em><span> since December 31, 1899 at midnight (represented by 0; 1 represents a day later or January 1, 1900 at midnight). &nbsp;Fractions of days affect the hours so e.g., 3.25 represents January 3, 1900 at 6am (3 and 1 quarter day after December 31 at midnight). &nbsp;</span>From&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/214094/how-to-use-dates-and-times-in-excel">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/214094/how-to-use-dates-and-times-in-excel</a><span>&nbsp;:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span>"In this system, the serial number 1 represents 1/1/1900 12:00:00 a.m. Times are stored as decimal numbers between .0 and .99999, where .0 is 00:00:00 and .99999 is 23:59:59. The date integers and time decimal fractions can be combined to create numbers that have a decimal and an integer portion. For example, the number 32331.06 represents the date and time 7/7/1988 1:26:24 a.m."</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span>In JavaScript, Dates are represented by the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 at midnight UTC (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">Coordinated Universal Time</a>), where 0 represents this time. &nbsp;If you enter <code>console.log(new Date(0)); </code></span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">in the Eastern US, you will get "Wed Dec 31 1969 19:00:00 GMT-0500 (EST)." &nbsp;This is because Eastern Standard Time is 5 hours behind UTC (represented by the -0500). &nbsp;Note that there are 1000 milliseconds (ms) in a second so&nbsp;i<span>f you enter <code>console.log(new Date(4000)); </code></span>in the Eastern US, you will get "Wed Dec 31 1969 19:00:04 GMT-0500 (EST)." (4 seconds later) &nbsp;From the documentation at&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date</a>&nbsp;:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><code>Date</code><span> objects are based on a time value that is the number of milliseconds since 1 January, 1970 UTC (midnight).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Quick Overview</strong>:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">For this first assignment, you will write code to make it possible for a user to enter a number in a cell and then change its format to "Time (given in ms)" or "Time (given in days)", whereby the&nbsp;cell will display the corresponding time. &nbsp;(Days and dates will be handled in a later assignment.)</span></p>
<h3><strong>PART A: Time in milliseconds</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Go to your GitHub Repository and select <code>app.js</code>. Then click the pencil to edit this file. &nbsp;Scroll down to the place where it says "<code>@todo FOR ASSIGNMENT 2, ADD YOUR OWN FUNCTION DEFINITIONS AS DIRECTED IN THE ASSIGNMENT</code>". &nbsp;This is where you'll add your functions.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Define a function <code>convertToLarger</code> that takes two inputs, a number and a positive integer conversion factor, and returns the total number of <span style="font-weight: bold;">whole</span> units in the number with that conversion factor. For example, if you wanted to convert 30 quarters to dollars, you could call <code>convertToLarger(30, 4)</code>, reflecting that there are 4 quarters in a dollar and get 7 as an output, the number of whole dollars you could get from 30 quarters. &nbsp;So the conversion factor here is 4. &nbsp;Note that you could also use&nbsp;<code>convertToLarger(30, 4)</code> to convert from 30 quarts to gallons since the conversion factor is the same (4 quarts in a gallon).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Using <code>convertToLarger</code>, define a function <code>msToTotalSeconds</code> that converts the given number of milliseconds to seconds.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Using <code>msToTotalSeconds</code> and <code>convertToLarger</code>, define a function <code>msToTotalMinutes</code> that converts the given number of milliseconds to minutes.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Using <code>msToTotalMinutes</code> and <code>convertToLarger</code>, define a function <code>msToTotalHours</code> that converts the given number of milliseconds to the total number of hours.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Define a function <code>remainingAfterConvert</code> that takes two inputs<span>, a number and a positive integer conversion factor, and returns the total number of <strong>whole&nbsp;remaining smaller&nbsp;</strong></span><span>units after&nbsp;the number with that conversion factor has been removed. For example, if you wanted to get the remaining number of&nbsp;quarters from 30 after you've converted as many of them as you can to&nbsp;dollars, you could call </span><code>remainingAfterConvert(30, 4)</code><span>, reflecting that there are 4 quarters in a dollar and get 2&nbsp;as an output, the number of quarters&nbsp;remaining after you take out the 7 dollars.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Using <code>msToTotalSeconds</code> and <code>remainingAfterConvert</code>, define a function <code>getSecondFromMs</code> that takes the given number of milliseconds from midnight and returns the second (0 to 60) for the displayed time. &nbsp;<strong>Note</strong>: This function is already present in the code; remove the 0 and replace it with the appropriate expression.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Using <code>msToTotalMinutes</code> and <code>remainingAfterConvert</code>, define a function <code>getMinuteFromMs</code> that takes the given number of milliseconds from midnight and returns the minute (0 to 60) for the displayed time. &nbsp;<strong>Note<span>: </span></strong>This function is already present in the code; remove the 0 and replace it with the appropriate expression.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Using <code>msToTotalHours</code> and <code>remainingAfterConvert</code>, define a function <code>getHourFromMs</code> that takes the given number of milliseconds from midnight and returns the hour (0 to 24) for the displayed time. &nbsp;<strong>Note<span>: </span></strong>This function is already present in the code; remove the 0 and replace it with the appropriate expression.</span></li>
<li>Document each function you define in the JSDoc format (see: <a href="http://usejsdoc.org/">http://usejsdoc.org/</a>&nbsp;) immediately above the function definition.&nbsp; The documentation for&nbsp;<code>getSecondFromMs</code> is already present for you to use as a model.</li>
</ol>
<p>Be sure to test your functions on <a href="https://repl.it/languages/babel">https://repl.it/languages/babel</a>&nbsp;first before committing the change. &nbsp;Once you're satisfied that they're correct,&nbsp;commit the change with an appropriate name (e.g., enabled&nbsp;hour-minute-second conversion from ms perhaps with an extended description that the ms are taken from midnight). &nbsp;Note the time offset is not yet handled. &nbsp;If you completed this task correctly, you should be able to go to your spreadsheet app at https://<em>username</em>.github.io/spreadsheet-app-fall2017 (replacing username with your GitHub username), enter a number of ms in a cell, right-mouse click that cell and select Format &gt; Time (given in ms) from the context menu that appears and see the correct time. &nbsp;<strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;As of now the display is formed by joining together the hour, a :, the minute, a :, and the second so you'll be missing leading 0's for minutes and seconds (e.g., noon appears as 12:0:0). &nbsp;We'll be correcting this later, but for a little extra credit, see if you can do some internet research to correct it yourself. (E.g., check out documentation at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript</a>&nbsp;)</p>
<h3><strong>PART B: Time in days</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Go to your GitHub Repository and select <code>app.js</code>. Then click the pencil to edit this file as before in part A. &nbsp;Scroll down to the same part as before.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Define a function <code>convertToSmaller</code>&nbsp;that takes two inputs, a number and a positive integer conversion factor, and returns the total number of <span style="font-weight: bold;">fractional</span>&nbsp;units in the number with that conversion factor. For example, if you wanted to convert 2.74&nbsp;dollars&nbsp;to quarters, you could call <code>convertToSmaller(2.74, 4)</code>, reflecting that there are 4 quarters in a dollar and get 10.96 as an output, the equivalent number of quarters you could get from 2.74&nbsp;dollars.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Using <code>convertToSmaller</code>, define a function <code>daysToTotalHours</code>&nbsp;that converts the given number of days&nbsp;to an equivalent number of&nbsp;hours. &nbsp;You may get a decimal as an answer from this function.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Using <code>daysToTotalHours</code>&nbsp;and <code>convertToSmaller</code>, define a function days<code>ToTotalMinutes</code> that converts the given number of days&nbsp;to an equivalent number of&nbsp;minutes. &nbsp;<span>Again, you may get a decimal as an answer from this function.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Using <code>daysToTotalMinutes</code> and <code>convertToSmaller</code>, define a function days<code>ToTotalSeconds</code>&nbsp;that converts the given number of days&nbsp;to an equivalent&nbsp;number of seconds. &nbsp;<span>Again, you may get a decimal as an answer from this function.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Return to your previously defined&nbsp;function <code>remainingAfterConvert</code> that takes two inputs<span>, a number and a positive integer conversion factor, and returns the total number of <strong>whole</strong>&nbsp;<strong>remaining smaller&nbsp;</strong></span><span>units after&nbsp;the number with that conversion factor has been removed. &nbsp;Update it if necessary to make sure that it can handle a decimal input for the number. &nbsp;For example, if you wanted to get the remaining number of&nbsp;quarters from 21.96&nbsp;after you've converted as many of them as you can to&nbsp;dollars, you could call </span><code>remainingAfterConvert(21.96, 4)</code><span>, reflecting that there are 4 quarters in a dollar and get 1&nbsp;as an output, the number of <strong>whole</strong> quarters&nbsp;remaining after you take out the 5&nbsp;dollars.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Using <code>daysToTotalHours</code>&nbsp;and <code>remainingAfterConvert</code>, define a function <code>getHourFromDays</code>&nbsp;that takes the given number of days in decimal&nbsp;from midnight and returns the hour&nbsp;(0 to 24) for the displayed time. &nbsp;<strong>Note</strong><span>: This function is already present in the code; remove the 0 and replace it with the appropriate expression.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Using <code>daysToTotalMinutes</code> and <code>remainingAfterConvert</code>, define a function <code>getMinuteFromDays</code>&nbsp;that takes the given number of days in decimal form&nbsp;from midnight and returns the minute (0 to 60) for the displayed time. &nbsp;<strong>Note</strong><span>: This function is already present in the code; remove the 0 and replace it with the appropriate expression.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Using <code>daysToTotalSeconds</code>&nbsp;and <code>remainingAfterConvert</code>, define a function <code>getSecondFromDays</code> that takes the given number of days in decimal form&nbsp;from midnight and returns the second&nbsp;(0 to 60) for the displayed time. &nbsp;<strong>Note</strong><span>: This function is already present in the code; remove the 0 and replace it with the appropriate expression.</span></span></li>
<li>Document each function you define in the JSDoc format (see: <a href="http://usejsdoc.org/">http://usejsdoc.org/</a>&nbsp;) immediately above the function definition.&nbsp; The documentation for&nbsp;<code>getSecondFromMs</code> is already present for you to use as a model.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span></span></span></li>
</ol>
<p>Be sure to test your functions on https://repl.it/languages/babel first before committing the change. Once you're satisfied that they're correct, commit the change with an appropriate name (e.g., enabled hour-minute-second conversion from day perhaps with the extended description that that this day is expressed as a decimal following the Excel format with the fractional part representing the fraction of the day from midnight.) &nbsp;<span>&nbsp;If you completed this task correctly, you should be able to go to your spreadsheet app at https://</span><em>username</em><span>.github.io/spreadsheet-app-fall2017 (replacing username with your GitHub username), enter a fractional number of days in a cell, right-mouse click that cell and select Format &gt; Time (given in days)&nbsp;from the context menu that appears and see the correct time. &nbsp;As before, we will be&nbsp;correcting the single-digit issue mentioned above for minutes and seconds at a later time (or you can handle it now for a little extra credit.)</span></p>
